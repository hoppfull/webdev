  Writing down the compilation commands in the console every time we want to compile
  will be quite unmanageable for even small projects. To deal with this we create
  batch scripts. Basically a batch script is a text file where we store console
  commands so that we don't have to write them down manually.
  <br/><br/>
  
  To create a batch script simply create a text file and name it something like
  "<i>compile.bat</i>". To reduce clutter in the terminal when running I
  start all scripts with:
  <div class="batch_script code"
>@ECHO OFF</div>
  
  <br/>
  
  We make calls in the command console with the <i>CALL</i> keyword. Example:
  <div class="batch_script code"
>CALL cd..</div>
  This is the equivalent of:
  <div class="cmd_console code"
>C:\dir\>cd..

C:\>_</div>
  
  <br/>
  
  For example: we have a source file we want to compile and then immediately run
  the result.
  
  <br/><br/>
  
  <i>myprog.fs</i>:
  <pre><code class="fsharp code"
>printfn "hello batch scripting!!!11!one!"</code></pre>
  <i>cmplandrun.bat</i>:
  <div class="batch_script code"
>@ECHO OFF

CALL fsc myprog.fs

CALL myprog.exe</div>
  
  Now we run the script:
  <div class="cmd_console code"
>projectfolder\>cmplandrun
