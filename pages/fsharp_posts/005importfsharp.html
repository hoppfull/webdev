  <div class="page_fsharp_header">Import external file (F#)</div>
  
  Sometimes we want to organize our code by putting related code in different files.
  <br/><br/>
  
  A safety feature of F# is that files can only inherit from each other in a one way
  order. That means file A cannot inherit from file B if B inherits from A. The way
  this is implemented is through the order in which we compile the files. Parents
  first followed by their children.
  <br/><br/>
  
  We got two kinds of external files to inherit; namespaces and modules. Modules can
  contain defined values while namespaces can only contain functions (There's
  probably more to it).
  <br/><br/>
  
  Create a parent file called <i>mymodule.fs</i> and define it as a module named
  <i>whatever</i> then define a value:
  <pre><code class="fsharp code"
>module whatever

let x = "hello my friends!"</code></pre>
  
  <br/>
  
  Now create a child file called <i>myprog.fs</i> and use data from the
  <i>whatever</i> module:
  
  <pre><code class="fsharp code"
>printfn "%s" whatever.x</code></pre>
  
  <br/>
  
  When compiling make sure to list all files in project and order them accordingly:
  <div class="cmd_console code"
>...\projectfolder\>fsc mymodule.fs myprog.fs

..\projectfolder\>_</div>
  
  Run myprog.exe:
  
  <div class="cmd_console code"
>...\projectfolder\>myprog
hello my friends!

...\projectfolder\>_</div>
  
  <script>$('pre code').each(function(i, block) {hljs.highlightBlock(block);});</script>
</div>
