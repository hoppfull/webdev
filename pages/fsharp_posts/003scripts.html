  Script files are also very good for learning and experimenting. But I'm sure there are
  legitimate uses in projects for scripts. You don't have to compile scripts, you can just
  run them straight away.
  <br/><br/>
  
  Create a project folder somewhere. Inside your folder, create a text file and name it something
  like <i>myscript.fsx</i>. Write some code in <i>myscript.fsx</i>:
  
  <pre><code class="fsharp code"
>printfn "Hello World!"</code></pre>
  
  <br/>
  
  Navigate to your project directory in the command console <i>(hint: press shift + right
  click the project folder and press "Open command window here")</i> and run the script
  with <i>fsi</i>:
  
  <div class="cmd_console code"
>...\projectfolder\>fsi myscript.fsx
Hello World!

...\projectfolder\>_</div>
  
  <script>$('pre code').each(function(i, block) {hljs.highlightBlock(block);});</script>
</div>
