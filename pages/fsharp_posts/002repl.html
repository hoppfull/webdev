  The REPL is used to work with F# interactively. Like for testing small snippets of code
  which can be very useful during development or learning for experimentation.
  <br/><br/>
  
  
  The REPL is started in the console by running <i>fsi</i>:
  <div class="cmd_console code"
>C:\> fsi

  We write code and end a statement with "<i>;;</i>":
  <div class="cmd_console code"
>> printfn "hello whatsup";;
hello whatsup
val it : unit = ()
> _</div>

  <br/>
  
  Exit the REPL with the "<i>#quit;;</i>" command:
  <div class="cmd_console code"
>> #quit;;
