  The forward pipeline operator is a binary infix operator - a
  syntactic tool to make code easier to read. It's called "the most
  important operator in F#".
  <br/><br/>
  
  A trivial example:
  <pre><code class="fsharp code"
>let f x = x * 2

// Forward pipeline operator: |>
// 10 is fed as input to f:
let result = 10 |> f  // result = 20</code></pre>
  
  <br/>
  
  It seems similair to the composition operator in
  <i>ex04 - Composing Functions</i> but the difference is that the pipe
  operator is a function call while the composition operator is a
  function definition.
  <pre><code class="fsharp code"
>// without the forward pipe operator this becomes unintuitive:
let result1 = ((fun x -> x + 100) ((fun x -> x - 2) ((fun x -> x * 2) 10)))

// with the forward pipe operator this becomes much easier to read and understand:
let result2 =
  10  // take 10
  |> (fun x -> x * 2)  // and then double
  |> (fun x -> x - 2)  // and then subtract 2
  |> (fun x -> x + 100)  // and then add 100
  
// result1 = result2
</code></pre>
