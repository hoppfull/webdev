  <div class="page_fsharp_header">Setting up F# in windows</div>
  
  F# is included in an installation of .Net. Add an environment variable to path of the F# compiler.
  For me this happen to be: "<i>C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\F#\3.1\Framework\v4.0\</i>".
  <br/><br/>
  
  We need access to <i>fsi.exe</i> and <i>fsc.exe</i>. <i>fsi.exe</i> gives us access to
  the REPL and is used to run scripts which is great for experimenting while learning F#.
  <i>fsc</i> is used to compile source files into .exe-files for distribution.
  <br/><br/>
  
  Try running <i>fsi</i> and <i>fsc</i> in command console like this:
  <div class="cmd_console code"
>C:\> fsi

  You're in the REPL now. To exit type "<i>#quit;;</i>" and press enter:
  <div class="cmd_console code"
>> #quit;;

  If you're seeing this then you're good to go. Else go use your Google-muscles.

  Next let's see if the F#-compiler works like it should You should see this:
  <div class="cmd_console code"
>C:\>fsc

  Don't worry about the error. We didn't give the compiler any files to compile so all is good.
