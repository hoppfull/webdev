  I'm not going to bother explaining compiling source with an IDE since there's plenty
  of info the webz.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  
  Create a project folder and inside it create a text file named something like
  "<i>myprog.fs</i>".
  <br/>Add some code:
  
  <pre><code class="fsharp code"
>printfn "yo!"</code></pre>
  
  <br/>
  
  Open command console and navigate to your project folder and compile source with
  <i>fsc</i>:
  <div class="cmd_console code"
>...\projectfolder\>fsc myprog.fs

...\projectfolder\>_</div>
  The compiler will have created an executable <i>myprog.exe</i> in project folder. You
  should now in theory be able to distribute your program and run it on any computer
  with .Net installed.
  
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Run your compiled program with the console in order to see its output:
  
  <div class="cmd_console code"
>...\projectfolder\>myprog
yo!

...\projectfolder\>_</div>
  
  <script>$('pre code').each(function(i, block) {hljs.highlightBlock(block);});</script>
</div>
