  Comments are blocks of text in our source files that will not be
  evaluated at runtime by F#. We insert comments into our code to
  explain with our own words what is going on.
  <br/><br/>
  
  Ignore text in one line only (called single line comments):
  <pre><code class="fsharp code"
>//this is a single line comment!</code></pre>
  
  Ignore text between two points (called multi line comments):
  <pre><code class="fsharp code"
>(*this is a multi line comment!
yay!*)</code></pre>

  <i>printfn</i> is the print function that returns output from your application to
  the command console. Personally this function makes up 99% of debugging for me
  when programming.
  <br/><br/>
  
  <i>printfn</i> can only return output from a string directly. No numbers or not
  even the string content in a variable. But there are tricks to get around that -
  string formating.
  
  <pre><code class="fsharp code"
>//This will output "hello" to the command console:
printfn "hello"

//This will not work:
printfn 42
printfn 3.14

//Even the content of a variable will not work:
let x = "whatsup"
printfn x

// To get around this we use string formating:
printfn "%i" 42  //cmd console:42
printfn "%d" 3.14  //cmd console:3.14
printfn "%s" x  //cmd console:whatsup</code></pre>
