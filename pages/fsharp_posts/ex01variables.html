  With variables we can associate a piece data with a name. In
  functional programming we avoid changing the data of a variable
  throughout execution. This means in fancy terms that we're avoiding
  state change in our programs.
  <br/><br/>
  
  To store a piece of data in a variable, use the <i>let</i> keyword:
  <pre><code class="fsharp code"
>//Store the integer value of 5 in a variable named x:
let x = 5</code></pre>

  This type of variable is immutable and cannot be changed. If we want
  a variable that is mutable we define it explicitly:
  <pre><code class="fsharp code"
>//Store the integer value of 42 in a mutable variable named y:
let mutable y = 42
printfn "%i" y  //cmd console:42

// Store a new value (ie. change state):
y <- 99
printfn "%i" y  //cmd console:99
</code></pre>
  
  <br/>
  
  All variables are statically typed. Static Typing is a safety feature
  which restricts variables and functions to only dealing with specific
  types of values (such as integers, characters, floats).
  <br/><br/>
  
  F# will not require you to always explicitly define the type of a
  variable. F# will infer its type based on the value passed to it.
  
  <pre><code class="fsharp code"
>let x = 3.14  // F# infers the type of x to be a float

// Type is explicitly defined (unnecessarily in this case):
let (y :int) = 42</code></pre>
